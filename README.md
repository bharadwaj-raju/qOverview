### Installation

Download and run:

    $ sudo ./install.sh

## How to Setup & Use

### Initial Setup

1. Set the `qoverview-config-server` command to run on startup.

2. Run the command `qoverview-config-server >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown` in a terminal.

3. Add items to the dock using the file `~/.config/qoverview.yaml`. See [Settings](#settings).

4. You can now put the `qoverview` command on a shortcut key, and/or a screen corner.

See your desktop's settings tool for these.

For putting qOverview on a screen corner, see [Binding to screen corner](#binding-to-screen-corner).

### Use

Press said shortcut key/screen corner and see!


**NOTE**: In qOverview, middle mouse button click on a window will *close* it. This can be disabled, see [settings](#settings)

## Settings

See the file `~/.config/qoverview.yaml`. It has all the settings (and is quite well-commented).

## Binding to screen corner

The `xdotool` utility will allow you to do bind qOverview to a screen corner or edge easily.

You can bind to the following corners and edges of the screen:

- `top`
- `bottom`
- `left`
- `right`

- `top-left`
- `top-right`
- `bottom-left`
- `top-right`

To do this, run the command

    $ xdotool behave_screen_edge EDGE_OR_CORNER exec qoverview

where `EDGE_OR_CORNER` is to be replaced with the position of your choice from the list above.

Also, set the above-mentioned command to run at startup.

## What works and what doesn't

Every feature of GNOME Activities is provided, exceptâ€¦

- Drag-and-Drop windows to workspaces
- A more natural layout for the windows
